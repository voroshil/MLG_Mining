[1.0.2]
- Fixed Bug causing script to crash when a Mob or Player was in front of the turtle (caused by changes on the turtle API)

[1.0.1]
- Small Bugfix in api_sharedPrograms, which meant that using the programs with just one chest would not work

[1.0]
- Added an automatic updater for the programs
- I suggest adding cobblestone as an ignore block too, I myself have replaced wood with cobblestone
  in my default line-up of 6 items: "Smooth stone, dirt, gravel, cobblestone, marble, stone bricks"
  If you don't do this in some very specific cases, where lava meets water in a certain way, the
  turtle may or may not get stuck. Though the changes in the next two bullets solved some of the problems
- The movement of the turtle got improved: this fixed some troubles people were having
- Certain Obstructions will now be handled more elegantly
- The turtle will now notify the user when it needs more torches (via its terminal) 
- Torch restocking is now properly functioning
- Torch placement is improved when using 'digSidesToo'
- Torch placement got changed to avoid dark spots in the shafts: it will now place a torch every 6 block
- Using the programs with just one chest should now work
- General Debugging
